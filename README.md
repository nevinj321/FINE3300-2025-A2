Part B: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis
- Combined CPI data files for Canada and each province using Pandas, converting monthly data into a single, structured DataFrame for all 11 sources.

- Calculated important CPI-based statistics:

- Average month-to-month inflation rates for "Food," "Shelter," and "All-items excluding food and energy" for each province and for Canada.

- Identified which province experienced the highest inflation in the above categories.

- Calculated salary equivalence across provinces, showing how $100,000 in Ontario translates to different purchasing powers nationally (with "Canada" included as a national benchmark for meaningful comparison).

- Analyzed minimum wage in nominal and in real (CPI-adjusted) terms for 2024, and identified provinces with the best and worst outcomes.

- Computed the annual change in the CPI for services, and reported which region experienced the highest inflation for services.
